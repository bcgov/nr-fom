# Forest Operation Map (FOM) API - Backend

## Technical Details

Technology Stack: Node.js with Nest/TypeORM framework, PostgresSQL with PostGIS for database and migrations.


## Documentation

- See FOM documentation at [FOM Readme](../README.md).


## Local Development

Once set up, the stack can be access using the following paths on localhost:

- API: localhost:3333/api

### Docker Compose

- See [FOM Readme](../README.md)


### Local / Bare Metal

Run 'cd ../libs && npm ci' first. 

Run 'npm install' for this component.

Start commands are available in package.json.

OBJECT_STORAGE_SECRET = object storage secret, available in the OpenShift dev secret `fom-object-storage-dev`

Here's how to run only the api locally:

```
# Source local variables
source ./localdev.env      # Linux, MacOS

# Object storage secret
export OBJECT_STORAGE_SECRET=<hidden>

# Make sure 'libs' dependencies is installed
cd ../libs && npm ci

# Install node modules
npm i

# Build and run the api
npm run start:api
```

## Client Library Generation
These are the steps to generate the client library used by the frontend components (Admin + Public)
- Code changes to the API that are documented in Swagger using Swagger annotations like @ApiTags, @ApiProperty 
- Start the API component (npm run start:api) and access http://localhost:3333/api-json. Copy this content to 'openapi/swagger-spec.json'
- Remove the existing generated client library files. Delete the directories ../libs/client/typescript-ng/{api|models}.
- Generate the client library using 'npm run gen:client-api:ng'. Generated files will be placed into '../libs/client/typescript-ng'
- Copy the client library into the Admin and Public components in /src/core/api
