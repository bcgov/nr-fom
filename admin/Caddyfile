# Some Notes.

# If 'root' directive is used, it has to be before other directives such as 'try_files'.

# Below only work for general, it does not work for subfolder files access; e.g., /admin/assets
# try_files {path} {path}/ {file} /index.html

# This is similar like handle_path above and works as well for try_files subfolders.
# route /admin/* {
#      uri strip_prefix /admin
#      try_files {path} {path}/ {file} /index.html
