# Forest Operation Map (FOM)

FOM projects (proposals for logging, essentially) are submitted to FOM and made available for public review and comment. The submitting organization then needs to address the comments before submitting the project to the ministry.

## Technical Details

Technology Stack: Angular, Node.js, PostgresSQL with PostGIS running in OCP v4

This repo is for the Node.js API backend.

## Local Development

### Run API Backend (directly from code base)

- Install node and docker desktop (with WSL2 on Windows 10)
- npm install -g ts-node
- npm install -g typeorm
- git clone https://github.com/bcgov/nr-fom-api.git
- npm install
- docker-compose up -d db
- npm run typeorm:migrate
- npm run start:api
- Navigate to http://localhost:3333/api

### Run API Backend as open-shift style container

- docker build -f docker/api/Dockerfile.local -t api .
- docker run -d --name api -p 3333:3333 -u 1001 --read-only -e DB_PASSWORD=test -e DB_NAME=api-db -e DB_USERNAME=postgres -e DB_HOST=localhost -e DB_TYPE=postgres -e DB_PORT=5432 api
- WARNING: Currently doesn't work - fails with Error: connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:5432

### Connect to local database:

- Install dbeaver or pgadmin
- Ensure database is running (docker-compose up -d db && npm run typeorm:migrate)
- Create PostGRES connection to local database using connection information as defined in docker-compose.yml

### To rebuild local database from scratch

- docker-compose down
- docker volume rm nr-fom-api_ms-postgres-data
- docker-compose up -d db
- npm run db:migrate-main
- npm run db:migrate-test
- (Although migrations are also run when starting the API component, test migrations only run if environment variable DB_TESTDATA = true)

## Application Specific Setup:

<!--- instruction on setup local environment and dependencies.. --->

This project uses the Nest API framework and the Nx monorepo platform / cli tools.
Nx is used to manage this repository and generate Nest components.
See FRAMEWORK.md for nrwl nx documentation.

Notes:

- We use a custom OpenApi template when generating the frontend api clients from our Api
- The `.fetch-template` bash script that does the clone and patch is in the `apps/api/openapi` dir
- To generate the API client execute `npm run gen:client-api`
- The generated client api library is located in `libs/client`

## Deployment (OpenShift)

See [OpenShift Readme](./openshift/README.md)

<!--- Best to include details in a openshift/README.md --->
