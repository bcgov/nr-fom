  <h2>Find Forest Operations Map</h2>
  <div class="intro-text">
    <p>The Province is responsible for managing Cutting Permits (CP) and Road Permits (RP) in British Columbia. The Forest Operations Map (FOM) is a prerequisite to obtaining a CP or RP, and allows the public to comment on planned forestry operations. In an average year the Province processes between 5,000 and 7,000 CP/RP applications. Planned cutblocks and roads can be viewed and commented on using the Government’s FOM website, or by visiting the FOM holder’s place of business during the commenting period.</p>
    <p>Use this site to find, learn about, and comment on FOMs throughout British Columbia.</p>
