    <p>The Province is responsible for managing Cutting Permits (CP) and Road Permits (RP) in British Columbia. The Forest Operations Map (FOM) is a prerequisite to obtaining a CP or RP, and allows the public to comment on planned forestry operations. In an average year the Province processes between 5,000 and 7,000 CP/RP applications. All of these planned cutblocks and roads can be viewed and commented on using the Governmentâ€™s FOM website.</p>
    <p>Use this site to find, learn about, and comment on FOMs throughout British Columbia.</p>
