# Forest Operation Map (FOM) LIBS

## Overview

- Libs folder contains shared codes (types, interfaces, functions, classes, components, custom library etc.,) for local development shared amoung 'public', 'admin' and 'api' projects.

- To use this libs, the referencing project needs to have some setup at its tsconfig.json. Please refer to each project for specific settings (on 'paths').

## Project Structure

Under 'libs' folder, current categories for the libs project contains:

"<code><b>client</b></code>" subfolder: 

   - This hosts the generated 'api' client library by using '@openapitools/openapi-generator-cli'. 
   - Only generate and update this folder when required, DO NOT manually touch generated files.
   - Generated library are shared by 'public' and 'admin' frontend for backend communication needs.
   - 'api' project does not use this library.

"<code><b>utility</b></code>" subfolder:
   - This is the common places for common code to be deposited and shared among other projects.
   - One specific 'user.ts' object is shared between 'api' and 'admin' and should be changed carefully.

## Requirement to Build for Project using LIBS

FOM has been migrated from mono-repo to none mono-repo for ease of resolving dependencies individually for each project (but not 'libs' with versioning). As 'libs' is a sibling project beside other projects, for the individual project to use it and to build, you do require to do following steps first before building individual project:
- cd libs
- npm ci

## Client Library Generation
- See [Client Library Generation](../api/README.md)
