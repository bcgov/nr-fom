# Some Notes.

# If 'root' directive is used, it has to be before other directives such as 'try_files'.

# Below only work for general, it does not work for subfolder files access; e.g., /public/assets
# try_files {path} {path}/ {file} /index.html

# This is similar like handle_path above and works as well for try_files subfolders.
# route /public/* {
#      uri strip_prefix /public
#      try_files {path} {path}/ {file} /index.html
# }

# Multi-lines for header's Content-Security-Policy won't work, it has to be enclosed in double quote as one line.
